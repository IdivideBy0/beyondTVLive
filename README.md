BeyondTV android mobile client

For those still interested in using BTV as a TV Streaming device I have completed what will probably be my last contribution to the BeyondTV community.

Instructions:

1. Download and unzip the mobile files into your "Beyond TV\www\" folder.
I have added the ability to enter your license, username and password in the first form.

2. Download the beyondtvlive.zip if you are on Android 3.0 and up. Uncompress and install the APK on your android device. 
This is simply a custom browser that allows devices > Android 3.0 (honeycomb) to perform asynchronous tasks in the background. 
For those suspicious of the code, I am also including the source code here for review.

3. You will need to install a video player capable of playing mms format. I use VPlayer from the google play store, 
however there are others such as Daroon player and even XBMC for android.
